# Project Overview

I wrote Jasmine tests for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. See Udacity's project description below.

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Instructions

To run the tests, simply clone or download the repository and open index.html in your browser.
